### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing fixed rules like:

``` Code
if email contains "lottery" → spam
```

In Machine Learning, we:

- Provide lots of example data

- Let the system learn patterns

- It then makes predictions on new data

??? info "📌 Simple Definition"

    Machine Learning is a technique where computers learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions.

#### 🧠 Real-Life Examples

* 📧 Spam detection in Gmail

* 🎬 Movie recommendations on Netflix

* 🛒 Product suggestions on Amazon

* 🚗 Self-driving cars

* 🗣 Voice assistants like Google Assistant

#### 📊 How It Works (Basic Idea)

- Collect Data
    * Example: House size and price

- Train the Model
    * The algorithm finds relationships (like slope in a line)

- Make Predictions
    * Predict price for a new house size

??? note "Other Notes:"
    ML offers a new way to solve problems, answer complex questions, and create new content. ML can predict the weather, estimate travel times, recommend songs, auto-complete sentences, summarize articles, and generate never-seen-before images. 

    In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content (like text, images, audio, or video) from data. 

    For example, suppose we wanted to create an app to predict rainfall. We could use either a traditional approach or an ML approach. Using a traditional approach, we'd create a physics-based representation of the Earth's atmosphere and surface, computing massive amounts of fluid dynamics equations. This is incredibly difficult. 

    Using an ML approach, we would give an ML model enormous amounts of weather data until the ML model eventually learned the mathematical relationship between weather patterns that produce differing amounts of rain. We would then give the model the current weather data, and it would predict the amount of rain.

### What is [Model?](MLAcronyms.md/#model)
 A model is a mathematical relationship derived from data that an ML system uses to make predictions.
                                or
 In Machine Learning, a model is the mathematical representation that learns patterns from data and makes predictions.

??? tip "Simply put"
    A model is a formula (or algorithm) that learns from data and gives output for new input.
