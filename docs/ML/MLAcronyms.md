#### Training 
    The process of determining the ideal parameters (weights and biases) comprising a model. During training, a system reads in examples and gradually adjusts parameters. Training uses each example anywhere from a few times to billions of times. 

##### Model
    In general, any mathematical construct that processes input data and returns output. Phrased differently, a model is the set of parameters and structure needed for a system to make predictions. In supervised machine learning, a model takes an example as input and infers a prediction as output.
